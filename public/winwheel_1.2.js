 Description:
 This script contains the functions to load the winning wheel image and do the rotation of it.
 By Douglas McKechie @ www.dougtesting.net

 Version History:
 1.0 (2012-01-28)
 - Created based off earlier version.

 1.1 (2013-04-23, though not released before on my site)
 - Added "Prize Detection" feature which works out the prize the user has won when the wheel stops.
 As part of this I changed the wheel graphic to contain less segments so easier to understand.

 1.2 (2013-07-14)
 SIGNIFICANT UPDATE
 - Added "Pre-determined" feature which allows the result of the spin to be predetermined by a server side process,
 or other code, then when the wheel spins it will stop at this pre-determined location or prize rather than a random one.

 This required changes to the spinning code so instead of counting down until no rotations left it spins upwards
 until the target angle is met. Also needed to change the code that works out the power to just set the power level;
 the new startSpin() function sets the targetAngle based on the power.

 - Decided to improve the slowdown code by adjusting the way the thresholds that change the amount of angle rotated by are calculated.
 While doing this I hit on the idea of making the lower thresholds random between a specified range so is harder for user to
 predict what they will win (which will could happen after playing the wheel a few times if the last threshold is always the same).

 - Added ability to reset the wheel by adding resetWheel() function. Called by click on link under spin button in example wheel.

 - Also overhauled the declaration of the global variables, moving ones that developers can alter to the top, and moving ones
 that should not be altered to seperate section. Also updated most of the comements describing what the variables do.

 - Added check that power level is selected before the wheel will spin (previously you could click Spin with no power selected) and
 also added variable to store the current state of the wheel - if spinning or not - so click of spin button while wheel is already
 spinning has no effect.

// --------------------------------
// VARIABLES YOU CAN ALTER...
var canvasId = "myDrawingCanvas";   // Id of the canvas element on the page the wheel is to be rendered on.
var wheelImageName = "cba_wheel.png";	// File name of the image for the wheel.
var spinButtonImgOn = "spin_on.png";		// Name / path to the images for the spin button.
var spinButtonImgOff = "spin_off.png";
var theSpeed = 20; 		 // Controls how often the spin function is called (is miliseconds value for animation timer).
var pointerAngle = 0;  	 	 // The angle / location around the wheel where the pointer indicaing the prize is located. Can be any value you like, 0 is top (12 oclock) 180 is bottom (6 o'clock) etc.
var doPrizeDetection = true; 	 // Set to true if you want the code to detect the prize the user has won when the spinning has stopped. Prizes need to be specified in the prizes array.
var spinMode = "random"; // Values can be: random, determinedAngle, determinedPrize.
var determinedGetUrl = "";  	 // Set to URL of the server-side process to load via ajax when spinMode is determinedAngle or determinedPrize.
/*
 The following files included in the download can be used to test the different modes (you will need an Apache server; I use XAMPP on my local machine).
 determinedPrize: get_determined_prize.php;  // Always returns "2" (so will win prize 3).
 determinedAngle: get_determined_angle.php;	// Always returns "67" degrees (so will win prize 2 using example wheel prize start and end angles).
 */

// --------------------------------
// SPECIFY PRIZES (alter this too)...
// Add items to the array which correspond to the prizes in the segemnts of the wheel.
// The important properties are the startAngle and the endAngle in degrees, the name and anything else you want to add is optional.
// In order to work correctly the the start and end angles need to match the begining and end of the segments for the prizes in your wheel image.
// Thinking about a clock face, 0 is at the 12 o'clock, 90 is at the 3 o'clock, 180 is 6 o'clock, 270 is 9 o'clock.
var prizes = new Array();
prizeNames = ["Water Bottle", "Nothing", "Event Invitation", "CBA Cash Credit", "Nothing",
    "Event Invitation", "CBA Cash Credit", "Water Bottle", "CBA Cash Credit", "Flash Disk", "Nothing", "Event Invitation",
    "Nothing", "Water Bottle", "Nothing",  "Flash Disk"];

var startAngle = 0,
    difference = 22.5;
for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    temp = {"name": prizeNames[i], "startAngle": startAngle, "endAngle": startAngle + difference};
    startAngle += difference;
    prizes.push(temp)
}
//console.log(prizes);
//prizes[14] = {"name" : "Prize 8", "startAngle" : 171, "endAngle" : 344.5};
//prizes[15] = {"name" : "Prize 8", "startAngle" : 171, "endAngle" : 195};
//prizes[16] = {"name" : "Prize 8", "startAngle" : 171, "endAngle" : 195};
// Idea: an idea I had for this, but not implimented, is that if you wanted some the prizes / segments in your wheel to be "winners" and some to be "loosers"
// you could add a property to the items in the prize array stating if win/loose and then in the doSpin function code that is executed when the spinning has
// stopped display different message / play different sound (or whatever) depending on if the user has won or lost.
